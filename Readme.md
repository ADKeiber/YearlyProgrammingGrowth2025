# Yearly Programming Growth 2025
The purpose of this Repo is to document my computer science journey including software engineering, certification studying/testing, and learning new topics. <br> <br>
NOTE: Some goals have been part of an effort started in November 2024 but will be showcased here.
<br>
There will be two notable sections of this file
* A list of computer science-related goals
* A daily recount of work associated with the above topics that I completed

## Goals
NOTE: These goals were set on 1/1/25 but additional goals may be appended while exploring
* Do projects from the backend [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas) (maybe) depending on results of exploration
  - Real-time Polling App
    - [In Progress](https://github.com/ADKeiber/Real-Time-Polling-Application) 
  - Simple E-commerce API
  - Movie Reservation System
  - Multiplayer Battleship Game Server
  - Database Backup CLI utility
  - Online Code Compiler API
  - Messaging Platform Backend
  - JS Obfuscator CLI utility
  - Web Scraper CLI
* Learn about High-Performance and parallel computing
* Complete 1st semester of Master's program
* Figure out if I wanna do embedded vs backend development
  - Experiment with Assembly (1 month) January
    -  BigInt Library Project
  - Experiment with C (1 month) February
    - Bus Reservation system
  - Embedded project (1 month) March
    - Pomodoro Clock/ project
  - Experiment with Python/DJANGO ( 1 month)
    - Music Library API
* Learn NeoVim
  - In Progress
* Push code/computer science updates every day (365!!)
* Linux certification
* Complete All 150 from [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) but in leetcode
  - In Progress 5/150

# Yearly Programming Growth 2025
The purpose of this Repo is to document my computer science journey including software engineering, certification studying/testing, and learning new topics. <br> <br>
NOTE: Some goals have been part of an effort started in November 2024 but will be showcased here.
<br>
There will be two notable sections of this file
* A list of computer science-related goals
* A daily recount of work associated with the above topics that I completed
